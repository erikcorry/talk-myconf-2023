# Conclusions

* Your language, and your libraries should not have foot-guns.
* The performance penalty of removing a foot-gun is often negligible.
* In fact, the performance penalty is often negative!
* Language and library implementers should respect their users.
* Users should respect themselves - demand more from your tools!
