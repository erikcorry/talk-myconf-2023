## Erroneous behaviour for uninitialized reads

p2795r5 introduces a new concept in the C++ standard: Erroneous behaviour.

Default-initialization of an automatic-storage object initializes the object
with a **fixed value defined by the implementation**; however, **reading that
value is a conceptual error**. Implementations are **allowed and encouraged to
diagnose this error**, but they are also allowed to ignore the error and
**treat the read as valid**.

Reading an uninitialized value is never intended and a definitive sign that the
code is not written correctly and needs to be fixed. At the same time, we do
give this code well-defined behaviour, and if the situation has not been
diagnosed, we want the program to be stable and predictable. This is what we
call *erroneous behaviour*.
